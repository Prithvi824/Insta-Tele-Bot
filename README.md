<h1> &nbsp; Please note, this is a Hobby Project.</h1> 

This is a script that follows the following Workflow:

It receives the link of a `instagram reel` using a post request -- `Downloads and saves` it on the drive -- When asked for the video it can send it using the `Telegram Bot` that it utilizes.

<h3> &nbsp; Here is how you can deploy it for yourself:</h3>

1) Fork this repo and clone it on your local pc.
2) Create a .env file with the following variables: <br>
    ```
    => OWNER - The telgram chat id of your account <br>
    => TOKEN - The verification token to of the telegram bot. <br>
    => PARENT_FOLDER - The folder id of the parent directory in drive <br>
    => FOLDER1 - The folder id of the first sub-directory in drive <br>
    => FOLDER2 - The folder id of the second sub-directory in drive <br>
    => FOLDER3 - The folder id of the third sub-directory in drive <br>
    ```
3) Install the requirements.txt
4) Run the main.py and you are good to go.
